# Cuckoo Filter

Cuckoo filter is a Bloom filter replacement for approximated set-membership queries. While Bloom filters are well-known space-efficient data structures to serve queries like "if item x is in a set?", they do not support deletion. Their variances to enable deletion (like counting Bloom filters) usually require much more space.

Cuckoo ﬁlters provide the ﬂexibility to add and remove items dynamically. A cuckoo filter is based on cuckoo hashing (and therefore named as cuckoo filter). It is essentially a cuckoo hash table storing each key's fingerprint. Cuckoo hash tables can be highly compact, thus a cuckoo filter could use less space than conventional Bloom ﬁlters, for applications that require low false positive rates (< 3%).

## Implementation details

The paper cited above leaves several parameters to choose. In this implementation

1. Every element has 2 possible bucket indices
2. Buckets have a static size of 4 fingerprints
3. Fingerprints have a static size of 16 bits

1 and 2 are suggested to be the optimum by the authors. The choice of 3 comes down to the desired false positive rate. Given a target false positive rate of `r` and a bucket size `b`, they suggest choosing the fingerprint size `f` using

    f >= log2(2b/r) bits

With the 16 bit fingerprint size in this repository, you can expect `r ~= 0.0001`.
[Other implementations](https://github.com/seiflotfy/cuckoofilter) use 8 bit, which correspond to a false positive rate of `r ~= 0.03`.
